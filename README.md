## 🚀 Project Overview

Welcome to the **Nexus LED Scoreboard** project! 🎉 This ambitious endeavor aims to create a dynamic, multi-sport LED scoreboard system that brings real-time scores and game information right into your home or fan cave. Imagine never missing a moment, with live updates glowing on a customizable LED matrix display.

Built with Python, this project is designed for versatility, interfacing with various sports APIs to fetch up-to-the-minute data and controlling LED matrices (like those powered by Raspberry Pi) for stunning visual output.

### Why Nexus LED Scoreboard?
* **Beyond a Single Sport:** Unlike existing solutions, we're building for *all* your favorite sports! 🏈🏀⚾⚽🏒
* **Real-time Immersion:** Get the latest scores as they happen, no refreshing needed.
* **DIY Spirit:** Perfect for hobbyists and makers who love building their own smart devices.

---

## ✨ Features (Planned & In Progress)

* **Multi-Sport Support:** Initial focus on major leagues (MLB, NHL, NBA, NFL, Soccer), with an extensible architecture for more.
* **Real-time Score Updates:** Fetching live game data from reliable sports APIs.
* **Customizable Display Layouts:** Options to tailor how scores, time, and other data are presented on the LED matrix.
* **Modular Architecture:** Designed with separate components for data fetching, rendering, and hardware control, making it easy to extend and maintain.
* **Event Notifications:** (Future) Potentially flash lights or show special animations for key game events (e.g., scores, home runs).

---

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

* **Primary Language:** Python 🐍
* **Hardware Interface:** `rpi-rgb-led-matrix` (or similar libraries for LED control)
* **Data Fetching:** Various open-source and official sports APIs (e.g., `MLB-StatsAPI`, others to be integrated)
* **System:** Primarily designed for Raspberry Pi OS

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

This section will guide you through setting up your own Nexus LED Scoreboard.

### Prerequisites
* A Raspberry Pi (or compatible single-board computer) 🥧
* A compatible LED matrix panel (e.g., Adafruit RGB Matrix Panel)
* Python 3.8+ installed
* Basic understanding of command line operations

### Initial Setup (Local Development)

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/peteywhit/nexus-led-scoreboard.git](https://github.com/peteywhit/nexus-led-scoreboard.git)
    cd nexus-led-scoreboard
    ```
2.  **Set up your Python Virtual Environment (Highly Recommended!):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv .venv
    # On Windows:
    .\.venv\Scripts\activate
    # On macOS/Linux:
    source ./.venv/bin/activate
    ```
3.  **Install development dependencies and your project in editable mode:**
    ```bash
    pip install -e . # Installs your project for development
    pip install ruff pytest pytest-cov # Essential tools for linting and testing
    ```
4.  **Run initial checks:**
    ```bash
    ruff check .
    ruff format .
    pytest
    ```

### Running the Scoreboard (Placeholder)

Detailed instructions for running the scoreboard on your hardware will be provided here.
